        <h3 class="reviews-heading">Synopsis</h3>

        <p>
          <em>Rae McKeon spent most of her life trying to reach her emotionally
            absent mother, Fern. Now that her mother has died, Rae seeks to
            discover the reason for Fern’s suffocating silences, the barriers
            she erected between herself and her family. The only person who
            could reach Fern was Rae’s daughter Hannah, but Rae has never been
            able to connect with Hannah either.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>From unruly child to defiant teenager to unwed mother, Rae always
            seemed to find the most self-destructive means of coping with her
            life’s challenges. But even though Rae could defy her strict,
            disapproving father, protecting herself from her mother’s chronic
            depression proved to be her toughest challenge. When Rae finds a box
            of her mother’s diaries, she is suddenly able to decode the path of
            Fern’s life, even while she tries to sort out her own life,
            including her strange relationship with her long-term boyfriend and
            her estrangement from her daughter Hannah.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Through three generations, Beyond Reach explores the oppressions
            that have silenced women for centuries. Fern is crippled by fear,
            Rae by shame, and Hannah by judgment. Just like the main characters,
            the answers often seem beyond reach.</em>

          <strong>A Wonderful Read – An Amazon Customer</strong><br />
          I absolutely loved this book. It’s been awhile since I found a book
          that I didn’t want to end. I loved the characters. And how this story
          flowed.
        </p>

          <strong><span class="caps">All too real!</span> – Joan G.</strong>
          <br />
          On the back cover I read that the book was about “oppressions”, but
          when I was reading it it seemed to me that it was about relationships,
          between men and woman and between parents and children. Over and over,
          it seemed that secrets, lack of insight, not only into others , but
          into ourselves, prevented people from having “whole” relationships. In
          addition, I could see how problems in one generation “bled” into the
          following generations. At times it seemed as if I could see the train
          barreling down the track, but I couldn’t step out of the way. I found
          the characters and situations believable and the writing compelling. I
          reflected on some similar situations in my own life and could
          empathize with characters who wanted to be different, but could not
          find their way.
        </p>

          <strong>Fantastic book! – An Amazon Customer</strong><br />
          Stellar writing and vivid characters contribute to a family saga
          filled with mystery and secrets. An absolutely top-notch novel.
        </p>

          <strong>Secrets kept beyond reach – An Amazon Customer</strong><br />
          Well written saga of generational pain in which three women experience
          emotional and physical pain by the people who are supposed to love
          them the most.
        </p>

          <strong>Didn’t want it to end! – An Amazon Customer</strong><br />
          Loved this book! Such strong and interesting characters – well crafted
          to hold your interest as the stories of these women unfold bit by bit.
        </p>

          <strong>Goodreads Review by Shauna Hemingway</strong> <br />
          Loved the inter-generational stories so masterfully woven together by
          author Sandi Plewis in this wonderful novel. Her tales, which seem to
          tell themselves, drive growth in the reader as the characters
          themselves mature with the advance of each chapter and story fragment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The author’s links to historical events and meaningful excerpts from
          poetry, songs and literature anchor her storyline and help bring the
          events and characters to life. I feel changed by the experience of
          reading her novel. Not all authors succeed in building a world that
          stretches well beyond the pages of their book, but Beyond Reach comes
          to life as much during its reading as in the quiet moments of
          reflection that follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for sharing your gift of storytelling. I already miss the
          characters and will have to return again to delve back into the world
          you so skillfully created. I am certain I will uncover new
          perspectives and gems in a second read.
        </p>

          <strong>Goodreads Review by Lyn</strong><br />
          Beyond Reach by Sandi Plewis, is a wonderful story of three
          generations of women trying to understand why their childhoods and
          their lives turned out the way they did. Spreading the story out from
          the 40’s through to the 90’s also points out the different behaviours,
          interactions and expectations of parents, their spouses and their
          children. Truly a great read!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Goodreads Review by Janet</strong><br />
          Loved this book! I became so involved in the characters and the
          intrigue around their stories that I could hardly put it down. It was
          not predictable, which I like. It kept me guessing right up until the
          end. Very well written Sandi!
        </p>

          <strong>Goodreads Review by V. Monforton</strong><br />
          Great book! It is not only an easy read, but very interesting! The
          characters are well developed and interesting. I heartily recommend
          this book!
        </p>

          <strong>Goodreads Review by Marie Black</strong><br />
          This was a great read. I couldn’t put it down.

          <strong>Sure-handed storytelling will keep you reading – J.E. Knowles</strong><br />
          Beyond Reach is a story of the secrets women keep and discover across
          generations. The author knows how to develop compelling characters and
          balance their story as it moves back and forth in time. Through her
          mother’s letters, the protagonist, Rae, learns that her own struggles
          come from somewhere; as she comes to learn the shocking truths of
          Fern’s life, she also finds strength to cope with her own. Beyond
          Reach will keep you reading to the end.

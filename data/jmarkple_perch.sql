(32, 'Page Body', '/writing-samples.php', '	<p><strong>May 1997</strong><br />\nShallow Rapids</p>\n\n	<p>	Iâ€™ve flooded the truck again. Thereâ€™s a loose ignition wire, but if I wiggle the key just right, it usually starts. Except at the worst times; when Iâ€™m late for work, or rushing to get to an appointment, or trapped in the yard at my parentsâ€™ old farm. All I can do now is wait for the gas fumes to drift away so I can crank the engine once more.</p>\n\n	<p>	Mary and Connor went out to dinner but it doesnâ€™t matter. I wouldnâ€™t go back into the house even if they were home. I donâ€™t drive out here very often. Hardly ever. Connor took over the farm years ago. I have nothing against my brotherâ€”not anymore. And Maryâ€™s been kind to me, although I always figured it had more to do with pity than friendship. â€œPoor Rae.  Sheâ€™s such a fuckinâ€™ mess.â€ No, Mary wouldnâ€™t say fucking. She reminds me of my old rubber dollâ€”blonde, pudgy faced, soft round curvesâ€”the one I cuddled when no one was looking. And she acts like the woman from â€œRomper Roomâ€. I used to watch that program when I was a kid, although even then I was sceptical. Iâ€™d never met anyone like the teacher on the showâ€”patient, soft-voiced, dripping motherly concern. I figured that they paid her to act that way, but I tried to trust her. My friends wanted to believe in Santa Claus. I wanted to believe in the Romper Room lady.</p>\n\n	<p>No, my problem with this place has nothing to do with my brother and his wife.</p>\n\n	<p>	A few days ago, Connor told me to take my pick-up truck into the garage and get them to tighten up the wire. But the last time I was there for an oil change, the mechanic told me that the oil was worth more than the truck. I need to buy something newer. This old Chevy is so rusted that the tailgate is threatening to fall off and daylight seeps underneath the driverâ€™s door. With the inheritance from Mom, Iâ€™m not exactly broke. Not rich either but comfortable, I suppose. But I have trouble spending the money. It sits in my bank account, collecting half a percent of interest every so often. Connor told me to invest it. Heâ€™s always telling me something. At least he has the sense to make it sound like a suggestion instead of an order.</p>\n\n	<p>	Iâ€™m parked on an angle and I can see across the yard to the barn and the small river behind it. All the buildings on this land sit on a hill that slopes down to the water. When I was young I used to walk into Shallow Rapids. I felt like I could step around the bend in the road and the farm would just blink out of existence. Then, when Iâ€™d come back, Iâ€™d round that bend and it would be there againâ€”the weathered white boards of the two-storey house; the tidy grey barn far across the yard on the river bank; the henhouse and drive shed unpainted and solid, sitting like rest stops in between the main buildings. Just like God waved His hand and made everything reappear.</p>\n\n	<p>	The cardboard box from Momâ€™s closet sits beside me on the bench seat of the truck. I could open it again and look at another diary. But I donâ€™t feel like doing it right now. I read through four books while I was inside the house and I didnâ€™t find a thing. Vague references, names I half-rememberedâ€”that was it. There are several other diaries in there and Iâ€™ll probably end up searching through every one of them. But I donâ€™t know what I expect to find. What would she say? <em>Dear Diary; Today I cheated on my husband.</em></p>\n\n	<p>	Maybe Mom used one of her dictionary definitions. Whatâ€™s a substitute for â€˜screwing aroundâ€™? Fornicate? No, that would have been too obvious. Cuckold? Where the hell did that word originate?</p>\n\n	<p>	I stare at the river. At one time I thought it was deep. Now it looks like a dribble. The grassy banks seem closer together. I remember lying on the slope behind the barn, stretching my toes toward the water and watching the cloudsâ€”trying not to think or feel or care, even if my backside still stung from the leather strap. I canâ€™t recall what I did, I just remember the belt. Dad didnâ€™t use it often, but I knew what to expect whenever he said, â€œThis time, youâ€™ve gone too far.â€ When he grabbed the belt and smacked me with it, there would be a smug expression on Dadâ€™s face, like a cat licking tuna juice off its whiskers.</p>\n\n	<p>	The image reminds me of the day when I caught my father with a burlap sack in his hand. He didnâ€™t notice me as he passed by the barn and walked down to the river. I could see something squirming inside the bag so I followed him. Dad didnâ€™t even hesitate as he tossed the sack into the water. It sank instantly. He turned around and spotted me on the riverbank, several feet away, watching him.</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>â€œDonâ€™t tell your mother,â€ he ordered when he approached me.<br />\nâ€œWhy? Whatâ€™s in the bag?â€<br />\nâ€œJust donâ€™t tell your mother.â€ Then he turned and left.</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>	I broke off a tree branch and tried to hook the bag from the water but I couldnâ€™t snag it. After a while I gave up. But it wasnâ€™t long before Dadâ€™s secret cracked open and spilled out.

Weaving Words\\r\\n\\r\\nh4. A Creative Writing Workshop\\r\\n\\r\\nOur lives are woven from connected stories: we are the weavers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter Sandi Plewis will teach a one-day workshop on *Saturday, April 26th, 2014* at *Your LightQuest Retreat Centre*, on Orchard Line near Goderich. The class will run from *9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.*, lunch and refreshments included. The cost for the workshop is *$85.00* for the day. This will be an interactive day so please bring paper, pen and your creative muse. The workshop will intersperse helpful writing tips with in-class exercises and explore ways to embrace the artist within you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, Sandi has taught successful level one and two courses, along with weekend workshops. Currently, she privately tutors students, edits and offers critiques to writing clients, has recently completed her latest novel, and is co-writing a screenplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimarily a short story\\/novel writer, Sandi Plewis had one first place win and two third place wins in the Alice Munro Short Story contest. As well, Sandi won second place in the 2010 province-wide short story contest sponsored by the Canadian Authors Association (Niagara branch). Her story was published in their _Ten Stories High_ anthology, along with three stories that won honourable mentions and had been published in previous anthologies. Due to her winning entries, Sandi served as the final judge in 2011 for the _Ten Stories High_ contest. She\'s also had short stories accepted into several literary journals including _The New Quarterly_ and _The Windsor Review_. Her poetry has appeared in _The Saving Bannister_ and _The Price of Eggs_.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo register for the April 26th workshop, please contact Sandi by phone *(519) 482-8619, \\\"or by email\\\":http:\\/\\/sandiplewis.com\\/contact.php, or contact Dianne Beach at (519) 524-5543 or at* \\\"yourlightquest@gmail.com\\\":mailto:yourlightquest@gmail.com. We are currently only able to accommodate eight participants, but we will compile a waiting list so that future workshops can be offered.\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nh3. Description of Opportunity\\r\\n\\r\\nTeacher and published author, Sandi Plewis is offering tutoring in creative writing with a specific focus on individual writers and would-be writers. By conducting one-on-one sessions, Sandi is able to concentrate on the needs of each person as she assesses the writer\\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Some participants will benefit from a basic 6-week writing course while more advanced writers may only need help with certain writing techniques. Sandi will read a submission from every participant and determine the best approach for each person. Critiquing and editing of selected material will also be offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tailored approach to writing provides flexibility as well as individual attention. If the participant wishes to pay per session (with no limit on the number), each session will be $35.00. If, however, the participant wishes to sign up for a 6-week course, he or she will receive six sessions for the price of five at $175.00 for the course.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the radius of Huron County, Sandi will meet with the writer in person, at either Sandi\\u2019s home or a convenient location. For writers further afield, Sandi will conduct the sessions over Skype with reading material e-mailed to the participant in advance. Critiques and editing will also be e-mailed. Writers can sign up at any time and can choose the weekday (or evening) that suits them. Tutoring will be offered Monday to Friday, weekends excluded. This customized schedule adds to the flexibility of this opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nh3. The Benefit\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you shine at description but your character development is weak. Or perhaps you\\u2019re familiar with \\u2018show don\\u2019t tell\\u2019 but have trouble creating fully-realized scenes. This customized approach to creative writing eliminates the monotony of a normal classroom setting. There\\u2019s no need to sit through a standard course that covers every aspect of writing and goes over techniques that you\\u2019ve already mastered. Also you receive individual critiquing and one-on-one conversations with the instructor. Plus you only pay for the number of sessions you need. If you wish to take more than six sessions, this is also an option.\\r\\n\\r\\nh3.

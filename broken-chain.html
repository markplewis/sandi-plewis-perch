          With colourful and captivating writing, Plewis paints this riveting
          story in the mind’s eye as only the best writers can. Highly
          entertaining! And very timely as the world reawakens to empaths and
          spiritual gifts.<br />

          What a wonderful book. I could not put it down. It brings the reader
          into small town Southwestern Ontario, with many twists and turns along
          with family secrets. I can’t wait for Sandi’s next book.
          Congratulations Sandi on a great Novel!<br />

          You will find it hard to put down…the characters captivate you!<br />

          One of the best books I’ve read in a long time. Great job, Sandi<br />

          After reading the description, I wasn’t sure what I would think of
          this book. Typically not my genre of writing, but Sandi captures the
          readers attention and holds tight for the story’s entirety. The
          characters are captivating, the stories intertwine beautifully and
          then all come crashing together as the book reaches its climax.
          Couldn’t get enough of this book, and I’m sorry it’s over.<br />

          Love when a story pulls you right in and this one does that and
          more.<br />

          A friend gave this book to me, and I’m so glad she did. Sandi Plewis
          draws you in to her story, connects you with her characters, and keeps
          you interested in what happens next throughout the novel. For me the
          story works on a number of levels, and it’s an accurate depiction of
          life in a small town in southwestern Ontario. I think most readers can
          relate to the community she writes about and the complicated
          interpersonal dynamics of her characters. Looking forward to her next
          book!<br />

          Very well written. Found this novel entertaining and suspenseful. A
          page turner to the end. I like the way Sandi mentions small towns and
          cities (London, Stratford, Kitchener to name a few) in the story
          line.<br />

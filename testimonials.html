        <h3>Testimonials for Teaching</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Sandi Plewis is a talented writer who helped me reach inside myself
            and express my story. Sandi listens to what you have to say and
            gives helpful advice with her expert editing on how to make your
            story more interesting and definitely encourages the writer to
            ‘show’ not ‘tell’. The best decision I made in 2007 was to sign up
            for her writing course. As Sandi has said, “Everyone has a
            story.”</em><br />

          <em>I wanted to thank you for the course. My point of view is that of a
            student but also one who was responsible for the pedagogy of 15
            schools and the curriculum from K-12. I was impressed with the
            detail of curriculum [in your class]. You present well, Sandi. I
            hope your other students know how well they are served.</em><br />

          <em>I really enjoyed and got a lot out of the workshops. Your
            preparation and knowledge along with your enthusiasm for the craft
            of writing were very impressive. You have given me a greater
            appreciation of the elements necessary for good writing, not the
            least of which are dedication and hard work. Thanks!</em><br />

          <em>It feels amazing to have done something I’ve wanted to do for years
            and I want to thank you for your role in that … I found the course
            informative, inspiring, humbling and powerful in many very personal
            ways. Thanks again for the work you put into it and, more
            importantly, for your passionate commitment to writing …</em><br />

          <em>Sandi is a wonderful teacher. I participated in three of her
            writing courses. I learned, through her encouragement, to let my
            imagination guide me and then to put my thoughts on paper using
            concise rules and suggestions. With Sandi’s help, I am now ready to
            send my stories to publishers.</em><br />

        <p>
          <em>I knew I enjoyed putting words on paper but had no idea how to
            build a story. Sandi provided the tools, exercises and examples of
            how to do so.</em><br />
          <em>More importantly, her positive and encouraging support kept me
            writing. She was precise and thorough in her critique of my work but
            also gave me ways to move forward to a far better story.</em><br />

          <em>I want to thank you for your honesty and your encouragement. I want
            to learn to make these experiences into a good fictional read … You
            are helping me with that …</em>

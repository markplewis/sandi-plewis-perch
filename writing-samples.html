        <h3>Writing Sample (from Beyond Reach)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>May 1997</strong><br />
          Shallow Rapids
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve flooded the truck again. There’s a loose ignition wire, but if I
          wiggle the key just right, it usually starts. Except at the worst
          times; when I’m late for work, or rushing to get to an appointment, or
          trapped in the yard at my parents’ old farm. All I can do now is wait
          for the gas fumes to drift away so I can crank the engine once more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mary and Connor went out to dinner but it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t
          go back into the house even if they were home. I don’t drive out here
          very often. Hardly ever. Connor took over the farm years ago. I have
          nothing against my brother—not anymore. And Mary’s been kind to me,
          although I always figured it had more to do with pity than friendship.
          “Poor Rae. She’s such a fuckin’ mess.” No, Mary wouldn’t say fucking.
          She reminds me of my old rubber doll—blonde, pudgy faced, soft round
          curves—the one I cuddled when no one was looking. And she acts like
          the woman from “Romper Room”. I used to watch that program when I was
          a kid, although even then I was sceptical. I’d never met anyone like
          the teacher on the show—patient, soft-voiced, dripping motherly
          concern. I figured that they paid her to act that way, but I tried to
          trust her. My friends wanted to believe in Santa Claus. I wanted to
          believe in the Romper Room lady.
        </p>

        <p>
          No, my problem with this place has nothing to do with my brother and
          his wife.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few days ago, Connor told me to take my pick-up truck into the
          garage and get them to tighten up the wire. But the last time I was
          there for an oil change, the mechanic told me that the oil was worth
          more than the truck. I need to buy something newer. This old Chevy is
          so rusted that the tailgate is threatening to fall off and daylight
          seeps underneath the driver’s door. With the inheritance from Mom, I’m
          not exactly broke. Not rich either but comfortable, I suppose. But I
          have trouble spending the money. It sits in my bank account,
          collecting half a percent of interest every so often. Connor told me
          to invest it. He’s always telling me something. At least he has the
          sense to make it sound like a suggestion instead of an order.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m parked on an angle and I can see across the yard to the barn and
          the small river behind it. All the buildings on this land sit on a
          hill that slopes down to the water. When I was young I used to walk
          into Shallow Rapids. I felt like I could step around the bend in the
          road and the farm would just blink out of existence. Then, when I’d
          come back, I’d round that bend and it would be there again—the
          weathered white boards of the two-storey house; the tidy grey barn far
          across the yard on the river bank; the henhouse and drive shed
          unpainted and solid, sitting like rest stops in between the main
          buildings. Just like God waved His hand and made everything reappear.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cardboard box from Mom’s closet sits beside me on the bench seat
          of the truck. I could open it again and look at another diary. But I
          don’t feel like doing it right now. I read through four books while I
          was inside the house and I didn’t find a thing. Vague references,
          names I half-remembered—that was it. There are several other diaries
          in there and I’ll probably end up searching through every one of them.
          But I don’t know what I expect to find. What would she say?
          <em>Dear Diary; Today I cheated on my husband.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe Mom used one of her dictionary definitions. What’s a substitute
          for ‘screwing around’? Fornicate? No, that would have been too
          obvious. Cuckold? Where the hell did that word originate?
        </p>

        <p>
          I stare at the river. At one time I thought it was deep. Now it looks
          like a dribble. The grassy banks seem closer together. I remember
          lying on the slope behind the barn, stretching my toes toward the
          water and watching the clouds—trying not to think or feel or care,
          even if my backside still stung from the leather strap. I can’t recall
          what I did, I just remember the belt. Dad didn’t use it often, but I
          knew what to expect whenever he said, “This time, you’ve gone too
          far.” When he grabbed the belt and smacked me with it, there would be
          a smug expression on Dad’s face, like a cat licking tuna juice off its
          whiskers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The image reminds me of the day when I caught my father with a burlap
          sack in his hand. He didn’t notice me as he passed by the barn and
          walked down to the river. I could see something squirming inside the
          bag so I followed him. Dad didn’t even hesitate as he tossed the sack
          into the water. It sank instantly. He turned around and spotted me on
          the riverbank, several feet away, watching him.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Don’t tell your mother,” he ordered when he approached me.<br />
            “Why? What’s in the bag?”<br />
            “Just don’t tell your mother.” Then he turned and left.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I broke off a tree branch and tried to hook the bag from the water but
          I couldn’t snag it. After a while I gave up. But it wasn’t long before
          Dad’s secret cracked open and spilled out. It was one of the few times
          when I actually heard Mom raise her voice against him.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “How could you? Dan, why? How could you do this?”<br />
            “For God’s sake, Fern … what the hell do you expect me to do?” Dad
            shot back. “Too many cats will over-run the place. It’s
            necessary.”<br />
            “It’s murder!”
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          They were standing near the silo when I came upon them. Dad had
          another burlap bag gripped in his hand. This time I could hear the
          kittens mewing inside it. My mother was trembling, her face pale. Her
          cinnamon red hair, usually so neatly pinned, had tumbled loose from
          the bun at the back of her head. I wondered if she’d been chasing
          after my father. She reached out and snatched the bag away from him.
          Dad’s eyes darkened.
        </p>

        <p>
          “You’re being ridiculous,” he burst out. “It’s just a bunch of cats,
          for God’s sake!” But he made no move to pull the bag away from her
          again.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that, cats swarmed over our property. Young, old, wild. Some of
          them had runny eyes and they all looked like they were half-starved.
          I’d lie on the riverbank after a spanking and think about the kittens.
          Dad only spared them because Mom cared enough to stop him.
        </p>

        <p>That’s why I hate coming here.</p>

        <p>
          I twist the key again. The motor turns over and kicks in. I breathe
          out a long sigh, yank the truck into gear and back away.
